Asynchronous JS

JavaScript can be asynchronous, meaning that operations can happen in parallel.
This is possible because JavaScript delegates operations to other processes using an event loop.

For example:
When we make a network request to an API, JavaScript delegates the request to the browser.
This allows JavaScript to continue running while the browser handles the request.
When the browser returns the data, JavaScript can then use it.

Asynchronous operations are common in scenarios like AJAX requests, file I/O, timers, Promises, and Async/Await
