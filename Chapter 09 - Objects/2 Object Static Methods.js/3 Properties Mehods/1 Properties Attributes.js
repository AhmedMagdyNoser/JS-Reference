Properties Attributes

Each Property of an object has a key and a value.
The value is considered one of the property's attributes.

These attributes define how the property can be used:

  1 Value: The value of the property.

  2 Writable: Determines whether the property value can be changed.
    If true, you can change the value of the property.
    If false, the property is read-only.

  3 Enumerable: Determines whether the property shows up during enumeration of the properties.
    If true, the property shows up during enumeration (for...in loop, Object.keys() method, etc.).
    If false, the property does not show up.

  4 Configurable: Determines whether the property can be deleted from the object and whether its attributes (other than value and writable) can be changed.
    If true, you can delete the property and change its attributes.
    If false, you cannot delete the property or change its attributes.
