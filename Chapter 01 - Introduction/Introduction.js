Introduction to JavaScript
  
==========================================================================

What Is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a dynamic, interpreted programming language primarily used for enhancing web interactivity.
It supports multiple paradigms including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
It's also used in server-side development through environments like Node.js.

==========================================================================

JavaScript Syntax

JavaScript borrows most of its syntax from Java, C, and C++, but it has also been influenced by Awk, Perl, and Python.

Statements are separated by semicolons (;)
Semicolon isn't needed if statement is on its own line.
For multiple statements on a line, semicolons are required.
Best practice: always use a semicolon to prevent potential bugs.
